In this course, students engage in the design and development of simple computer games, where they not only acquire progressively advanced computer programming skills but also delve into fundamental algebraic concepts. As they navigate the process of creating their own video games, students learn critical algebraic principles such as the order of operations, function composition, function definition, inequalities, piecewise functions, and the distance formula. Moreover, the movement and interactions of game elements are fundamentals of basic mathematical, geometrical, and physical principles. For example, the concrete application of abstract notions, such as motion and speed, occurs when game characters successfully capture rewards. This approach allows students to apply foundational knowledge from diverse subjects to problem-solving within the context of game development. The acquired computer programming skills are then systematically employed to articulate these intricate movements and interactions within a computer program. This educational journey unfolds in tandem with the exploration of key computer science principles, including reactive programming, data types, testing, and code reviews.
