Hi, I'm Ege Sirin, and my exploration of the captivating worlds of music and mathematics has been a journey of fascination and transformation. My passion for music, nurtured since childhood, took a more defined shape during my high school years. I supplemented my opera training from TOBAV with piano lessons at Dokuz Eylül University Conservatory, setting the foundation for my education in music. Inspired by my father and driven by a desire to expand my horizons, I found myself at Nesin Mathematics Village's summer school during the final year of high school, an experience that turned into a second home.

Upon an invitation from Prof. Dr. Ali Nesin, I started on my Bachelor's in Mathematics at Istanbul Bilgi University, supported by a full scholarship. During this period, my interest in Mathematics evolved, particularly focusing on Mathematical Logic and Theoretical Computer Science, delving into areas like Category Theory, λ−calculus, and Type Theory.

The inter-disciplinary research environment at Freie Universität attracted to me, offering a perfect opportunity to pursue my keen interests.  Here, I delved into diverse subjects such as Mathematical Modelling in Climate Research, Optimization, and AI in Air and Train Freight Management, as well as Traffic Optimization in Public Transportation Networks. 

As I continue to navigate the exciting intersection of music, mathematics, and applied sciences, I am enthusiastic about the possibilities that lie ahead in contributing to cutting-edge research and real-world problem-solving.
