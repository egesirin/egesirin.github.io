Volunteer

* Proofreader of the book: Matematiğin Sihirli Dünyası
  * I served as a proofreader for the Turkish translation of the book "Matematiğin Sihirli Dünyası" (The Magic of Math), originally authored by Arthur T. Benjamin with the title "The Magic of Math: Solving for x and Figuring Out Why." After the translation by Boğaç Karçıka, Hakan Doğan, Ayhan Dil, Uğur Doğan, Uğur Efem, I meticulously checked for any grammatical errors or inaccuracies in mathematical expressions before the book went into print.
* CMPE 283 - Secure Multi-Domain Virtual Hosting NGINX Lecture Notes Update
  *  I voluntarily updated the prepared lecture notes and codes for the CMPE 283 course given by Chris Stephenson at Istanbul Bilgi University.
